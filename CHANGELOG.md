2.0.0 - 2017-08-06
-----------------------------------------------

# New features in 2.0.0

Kit v2 introduces a few significant improvements that make it easier to upgrade between kits, and power-up your MedTantra experience:

## React v16 + new streaming SSR

React has been bumped to the new v16, and `renderToString` has been replaced with `renderToStream` -- for turbo-powered first page rendering of React to HTML.

Early tests have shown a promising reduction from 12ms+ for React-only rendering (no GraphQL) to 4-5ms on my local Macbook Pro, using out-the-box defaults.

What's more, on Node 8+, the asynchronous `createReactHandler` that sets up the Redux store, runs Helmet, initialises the component tree and starts the stream, has been benchmarked as low as 0.48ms on my same machine!

Your MedTantra project will be faster than ever.

## Kit API - a cleaner separation between 'kit' and 'app' code

In kit v1.x, the lines between MedTantra and your client code were a little blurry.  Editing the Apollo endpoint meant modifying `config/project.js`, which was a file that Webpack also used to assess whether to show the bundle optimiser post-build.

If you wanted to add anything more to the server or browser, you'd typically need to delve into `kit/*` files and make changes.

Now, the separation between two is clearer than ever. MedTantra v2.x introduces a new `Config` singleton instance that provides 'hooks' into adding functionality to the standard config, without mashing together custom code.

MedTantra is and always has been a 'starter kit', and will continue to be so. But now the framework-esque separation of client and kit code paves the way to clean abstractions, and easier upgrading.

In a future MedTantra CLI version, it's possible that you'll be able to upgrade an active project to the latest kit with a single command, instead of the current process of creating a new project, copying over `src` and manually/surgically editing kit files.

## Built-in GraphQL server.

MedTantra was originally focused on being a front-end starter kit.  But the effort put into creating a fast and capable SSR stack means you now also have an ideal home to run a monolithic GraphQL server, too.

Starting with 2.0, you're now able to add a GraphQL server easily, by add a few lines of code to `src/app.js`:

**src/app.js**
```js
// Import the new `Config` singleton instance
import config from `kit/config`;

// Enable GraphQL on the server -- this code will be eliminated from the browser bundle
if (SERVER) {
  config.enableGraphQLServer(require('src/path/to/schema').default);
}
```

That's it!

The above mounts a GraphQL server inside Koa at `/graphql`, gives you a visual UI to query data via GraphiQL, and sets up Apollo to point to the server URI automatically. It takes care of your server-side CORS config, and adds POST body processing for incoming GraphQL queries.

It also adds [apollo-local-query](https://github.com/af/apollo-local-query) to Apollo client initialisation on the server, so instead of routing requests over the network, GraphQL queries are made against the schema already loaded in memory -- eliminating TCP/IP overhead.

Of course, if you want to connect to a third-party endpoint, you can still do that easily:

```js
config.setApolloURI('http://example.com/graphql');
```

(Special thanks to graph.cool for allowing us to use their service in the starter kit in 1.x. Hopefully the move above will also take some load off your server :smile:)

## Add Redux reducers more easily

With the new `Config` API, you no longer need to edit `kit/lib/redux.js` to add custom reducers.

Instead, you can add them to `src/app.js` and keep reducers in userland:

```js
import config from `kit/config`;

// Create a reducer somewhere, shaped as { state, reducer() } -- this will
// probably be imported from a separate file
const someReducer = {
  // This is the reducer's initial state
  state: {
    someSetting: true,
  },
  reducer(state, action) {
    // ... reducer code to do something with `state`
  }
}

// Add the reducer, and specify the reducer key
settings.addReducer('someKey', someReducer);
```

## Custom routes

You can now add custom GET|POST|PUT|PATCH routes to the server, like so:

```js
// We can add custom routes to the web server easily, by using
// `config.add<Get|Post|Put|Patch>Route()`.  Note:  These are server routes only.
config.addGetRoute('/test', async ctx => {
  ctx.body = 'Hello from your MedTantra route.';
});
```

Routes will be added in insertion order, to obey your precedence rules.

## POST body parsing

`koa-bodyparser` is enabled by default, to process POST requests for a built-in GraphQL server or custom POST routes.

By default, it'll process JSON and form requests automatically.

You can disable with:

```js
config.disableBodyParser();
```

Or pass in your own custom options to `koa-bodyparser` with:

```js
config.setBodyParserOptions({
  // Example of a config option -- see https://github.com/koajs/bodyparser
  jsonLimit: '8mb',
})
```

## Custom 404 handler

The custom 404 handler added in 2.0 is one of several planned API 'hooks' that allow you to attach custom functionality to common server and browser entry points, without editing kit code.

This example ships in the starter kit:

```js
config.set404Handler((ctx, store) => {
  // For demo purposes, let's get a JSON dump of the current Redux state
  // to see that we can expect its contents
  const stateDump = JSON.stringify(store.getState());

  // Explicitly set the return status to 404.  This is done for us by
  // default if we don't have a custom 404 handler, but left to the function
  // otherwise (since we might not always want to return a 404)
  ctx.status = 404;

  // Set the body
  ctx.body = `This route does not exist on the server - Redux dump: ${stateDump}`;
});
```

You get access to the Koa `ctx` request context object as well as the Redux `store`, giving you the flexibility to handle responses in whichever way makes the most sense for your application.

In future kits, expect hooks to crop up in places like redirect and error handling.

## Neater `src` layout; more commentary

The out-the-box sample app that comes with a new MedTantra project is now better organised. Instead of a single `src/app.js` file, components have been given their own files/folders, and tons of extra commentary has been added to give you a better idea of what's happening under the hood.

Whilst `src/app.js` is still required in every project (that's where MedTantra will look for your app code), now the file should serve two simple purposes:

1. Configuring the app, per the new features above.
2. Exporting the root React component, to mount automatically inside `<Html> -> <div id="main"/>`

This best practice will make it easier to organise your code, and know what goes where.

Several components also demonstrate the pattern of asset co-location; images and SASS code is often in the same directory as the calling `.js` file, to make it clear which assets belong to which React components.

v2.0 documentation will land on https://reactql.org/docs soon.

All changes:

## Code layout
* Removes moot `config/project.js`

## Configuration
* Adds new `Config` class to `kit/config.js`, initialised as a singleton to use globally in `src/app.js`
* Adds the following new methods:
- `addReducer(key, reducer)` -- adds a new Redux reducer in the shape of `{state, reducer()}`
- `disableBodyParser()` -- disables `koa-bodyparser` in the server config
- `setBodyParserOptions(opt)` -- pass custom `koa-bodyparser` options to override defaults
- `addRoute(method, route, handler)` -- add new Koa route
- `addGetRoute(route, handler)` -- add new GET route
- `addPostRoute(route, handler)` -- add new POST route
- `addPutRoute(route, handler)` -- add new PUT route
- `addPatchRoute(route, handler)` -- add new PATCH route
- `addDeleteRoute(route, handler)` -- add new DELETE route
- `set404Handler(func)` -- sets a custom 404 handler, which is given `(state, store)` inside `createReactHandler()`
- `enableGraphQLServer(schema, endpoint = '/graphql', graphiql = true)` -- enables built-in GraphQL web server at `/graphql`, (optionally) enables up GraphiQL
- `setGraphQLEndpoint(uri)` -- sets the GraphQL server URI for Apollo. For use with external GraphQL servers.

## Browser
* Replaces ReactDOM's deprecated `render` with the new `hydrate` method, for rehydrating server HTML.

## Server
* Bumps to React v16's streaming API.

* Improves `getURL()` in `kit/lib/env.js`, to allow a boolean flag to enable HTTPS
* Adds `getServerURL()` to `kit/lib/env.js`, to explicitly get the web server host and port (typically for GraphQL)
* Refactors `kib/lib/redux.js` to derive config from the `config.reducers` Map

## Webpack
* Adds new `npm run build-analyze` option, to open a browser window showing the bundle analysis report after building

## App
* Refactors app code to tidy up the `src` folder
* Gives each component its own file/folder layout, with images/CSS co-located
* Adds tons of extra commentary to make it clearer how each component works
* Moves `<root>/reducers` to `src/reducers`, to reflect best practices

* Removes `kit/webpack/eslint.js` - which is now moot

## Server
* Closes #4 - Introduces server development bundling.  Now running `npm start` bundles _both_ a hot-reloading browser bundle, and a spawns server-side rendering that reloads upon code changes.
* Adds `distDev` route to paths, for server development bundled assets
* Adds `kit/webpack/server_dev.js` Webpack config for building and launching a development server

* Adds console messages to show server start-up info, including network IP and ports
* Fixes `__dirname` in the built server bundle, so that `dist/server.js` can be run from anywhere (mentioned in / fixes https://github.com/reactql/cli/issues/36)

## Helpers
* Adds `kit/lib/console.js` and `logServerStarted()` function, for dumping neat console messages to the screen when starting servers
* Adds `kit/lib/routing.js`, with `<Status>` (internal), `<NotFound>` and `<Redirect>` components for handling status codes, 404s and redirects, universally.

## Webpack / bundling
* Adds ability to use multiple webpack-configs in a given config file, by exporting as an array
* Tidies up `kit/webpack/base` with common stats; fixes path typo
* Adds `kit/webpack/dev.js`, which is extended by server_dev and browser_dev and adds the correct env vars and source-maps.

* Refactors `kit/webpack/browser_prod.js` to add console messages; fixes minor chunk hash typo
* Adds `css.getDevLoaders()` and `css.getExtractCSSLoaders()` helper functions to `kit/webpack/common.js`, for CSS configs that work across multiple configs
